100% from Ivan with some help from Jeffry for the factory design pattery. I was able to create the coins on my own but realized that the way I implemented it wasn't necessarily the factory design pattern taking place so Jeffry helped me out by explaining it and creating the parent class for the coins. I also had to look into my old projects to refresh my memory on some useful lines of code such as my first year GDW game for listeners.
I made the game Dot Collector by implementing the design patterns, singleton, factory, observer and command.
Singleton was implemented because it is my game manager and only 1 can exist at a time. If there are multiple, of the same singleton, then they'll delete themselves.
Factory was implemented by my coin system. A coin will spawn randomly and the factory will give it a chance to spawn as a gold coin or as a silver coin.
Observer ???
Command was implemented to change the players color. At the beginning of the game, the player has the option to press 3 buttons to modify the color that they play as.

Dot Collector is a 2D game where a player controls a dot and they have to collect coins around the map that spawn randomly to get the highest score possible while avoiding obstacles. 

The interactive media scenario that I have made is a 2D survival game where a player must try their best to collect as many coins before running into obstacles that will kill them upon collision. I made this project to deliver the assignment's deliverables and help improve my skills with game engine designs.
